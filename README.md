# Vincent Schoener 👋

Hi, I'm Vince, a Software Engineer from France 🇫🇷, passionate by programming, gaming, music, photo and traveling 🤗.

## Values 🌱
----
I love working with scalable and clean code architecture 📐, asking myself and my peers if it's still a good approach or if there is a better one out there to outperform and learn from it.

To sum up:

- Empathy
- Curiosity
- Open Mind
- Mentoring


## Current Status 😎
---- 
I'm currently working for [BackMarket](https://www.backmarket.fr/fr-fr) as a Senior Backend Engineer. We mainly use Python as our main language and other like Golang, minor TS and Elixir.

I've succesffuly finished my eMBA (Master for Business and Entrepreneurship). Now I'd like to evolve as a Engineer Manager and create my own company.

## Side works 🧑🏻‍💻
---- 

1. **Vincelivemix**

This project has been build from scratch with severals micro services: 
- [Backend](https://github.com/vschoener/vincelivemix) using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (TypeScript) managing episodes, RSS Generations and settings
- [Frontend](https://github.com/vschoener/front.vincelivemix) using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) React (TypeScript)
- [Authentication](https://github.com/vschoener/auth.vincelivemix) service using Golang to practice (still under development)
- GITHUB CI/CD
- Traefik, Docker and Docker Compose for the deployment and architecture management (Private repo of course 😘)
- Some APM using Grafana, Prometheus.

As I've done the major part and everything is running in production, I take my time to learn and finish the new services 💻.
Everyhing has been moved to Heroku/Vercel to save cost as I don't gain monay from it. So it's now quit unstable.

2. **Learning and Reviewing**

As I said, I've done a eMBA and I'm willing to improve my soft/hard skill to become an Engineer Manager.

3. *Medium stories*

I do love writing article to show how we can handle and setup stuff. I like helping people bringing my all expertise.
