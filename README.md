# Vincent Schoener 👋

Hi, I'm Vince, a Software Engineer from France 🇫🇷, passionate by programming, gaming, music, photo and traveling 🤗.

## Values 🌱
----
I love working with scalable and clean code architecture 📐, asking myself and my peers if it's still a good approach or if there is a better one out there to outperform and learn from it.

To sum up:

- Empathy
- Curiosity
- Open Mind
- Mentoring


## Current Status 😎
---- 
I'm currently working for [Kapten](https://kapten.com/) as a FullStack Developer working on micro service environment with NodeJs/TypeScript.

The adventure is ending and I'm now open for a new position. I have a lot of free time and use it to learn and practice.

## Side works 🧑🏻‍💻
---- 

1. **Vincelivemix**

This project has been build from scratch with severals micro services: 
- [Backend](https://github.com/vschoener/vincelivemix) using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (TypeScript) managing episodes, RSS Generations and settings
- [Frontend](https://github.com/vschoener/front.vincelivemix) using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) React (TypeScript)
- [Authentication](https://github.com/vschoener/auth.vincelivemix) service using Golang to practice (still under development)
- GITHUB CI/CD
- Traefik, Docker and Docker Compose for the deployment and architecture management (Private repo of course 😘)
- Some APM using Grafana, Prometheus (still working on it).
- [Admin](https://github.com/vschoener/admin.vincelivemix) Service on React as well under development too.

As I've done the major part and everything is running in production, I take my time to learn and finish the new services 💻

2. **Learning and Reviewing**

This is something I usually do every day but for my free time, I have some ideas in my mind I would like to explore

- Python
    - [TODO] I'm not a fan at the beginning but with time we change, so why not be open mind with this language and give it a try?
- Ruby 
    - [TODO] Ruby? Same as Python to be honest.
- Databases Postgres and Mongodb
    - To be honest, we lose values when we rely too much on our DB Architect and I need to review my skill, specially for the opti part.
- Gaming
    - [TODO] Working on Unity to develop games 🧙🏻‍♂️, Because I love games remember?
- Algorithmics
    - I started playing around with HackerRank. It fills sometimes my brain is gonna fall apart ahah!
- Machine Learning
    -  [TODO] It's something I would like to discover.


## Gaming 👾
---

Yes, I play games and I'm mainly focus on World of Warcraft and with my team we are focus to be 1st for PVE HL content. 

Here is my public log if you're interested https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/40222084

## Chill 🏃🏻‍♂️
---
I still have time to practice sport, travel and hang out with friends and colleagues (Beer, cocktails, PARTY? 🥳).
